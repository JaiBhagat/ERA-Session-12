## Assignment Objective

### Task Overview

1. **Transition to Lightning**:
    - Migrate your S10 assignment to PyTorch Lightning.
    - Retrain your model using Lightning.

2. **Deploy to Hugging Face Spaces**:
    - Ensure that you incorporate `Gradio` for interactive UI.
    - Your deployed app should:

        * Query if the user wishes to visualize GradCAM images, specifying the quantity, layer of interest, and allowing opacity modification.
        * Inquire if the user desires to see misclassified images and the number of them.
        * Facilitate image uploads by users and also provide a set of 10 sample images.
        * Allow the user to determine the number of top classes displayed (with a maximum limit of 10).
